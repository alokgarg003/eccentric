Eccentric is an eCommerce website designed to attract the new generation of users, offering them a seamless experience while purchasing electronic gadgets. The website's header navbar provides multiple options for students, including Home, Products, Categories, About Us, Contact, and a Search option where users can look up any product by its ID.

# Key features and functionalities include:
Users can browse items by category.
Users can search for items using either the product name or ID.
Users have the option to add multiple items to their cart.
Users can proceed to checkout with the items in their cart, enjoying a smooth transaction experience.

This project is aimed at enhancing our understanding of coding concepts, focussing on HTML syntax and CSS components. For functional requirements, we'll use JavaScript to make buttons responsive and create logic to build an interactive site. The technologies involved are HTML5, CSS (including box components and card styles), and JavaScript for frontend logic.
